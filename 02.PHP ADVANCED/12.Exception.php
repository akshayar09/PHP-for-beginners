// Unexpected program result that can be handled by the prgrm.
// try   --> represents a block of code in which exceptions can arise.
// catch --> represents a block of code that will be executed when a particular error has thrown.
// throw --> Use to throw an exception.
             Used to list the exceptions that func throws, but cant handle itself.
// finally --> Used in place of catch block after a catch block basically it is put for cleanup activity in PHP code.
